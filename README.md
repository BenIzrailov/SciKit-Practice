# SciKit-Practice

## First Day of Progress — Machine Learning / AI Roadmap

This project marks the start of my hands-on journey through machine learning and AI concepts using Python and Scikit-learn.  
The goal was to practice core data science workflows from dataset preparation to model training and prediction.

---

## Project Overview
In this first exercise, I:
- Loaded the Iris dataset from Scikit-learn.
- Explored the data to understand its structure and features.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
- Experimented with different algorithms for handling categorical and numerical data.
- Trained a model and made predictions on a sample data matrix.

---

## Tools and Libraries
- Python 3  
- Scikit-learn  
- NumPy  
- Pandas (optional, for data handling)

---

## Key Takeaways
- Learned how to structure a basic machine learning workflow.  
- Understood the importance of data splitting for unbiased evaluation.  
- Practiced making predictions on unseen data.

---

## Next Steps
- Try different datasets from Scikit-learn.  
- Compare the performance of multiple classifiers (SVM, KNN, Decision Tree, etc.).  
- Add data visualization using Matplotlib or Seaborn.  
- Explore data preprocessing and feature scaling.

---

## Reflection
Starting with a simple project helped reinforce the fundamentals of machine learning.  
This exercise emphasized how important proper data preparation and evaluation are before moving on to more complex models.
